                a specialplace. They provide us with constant joy and comfort, 
                becomingindispensable members of our families. Now, we aim to 
                harness theinnovative potential of blockchain technology to 
                revolutionize the realm ofpet adoption. The goal of Companion 
                Pet World is to utilize thetransparency, security, and decentralization 
                of blockchain to innovate theprocess of pet adoption, fostering 
                animal welfare and facilitating newconnections within families.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Inter">Blockchain leverages distributed ledgers and smart contracts 
                to offer atransparent and secure transaction environment. This 
                amplifies thetransparency of the pet adoption process, allowing 
                for safe management ofadopted animals' health records and genetic 
                information. Moreover,blockchain enhances post-adoption communication 
                between new ownersand pets, offering an opportunity to prioritize 
                the animals' well-being.</font></p>

                big data toprovide a comprehensive platform service for managing 
                the entire lifecycleof pets. Through genetic and lineage information, 
                we verify the heritage ofeach pet, while health check results 
                and disease history data enablesystematic health management. 
                This data is securely recorded on theblockchain, ensuring its 
                integrity and preservation. When needed, thisinformation can 
                be shared with veterinarians and experts to gain valuableinsights.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Inter">Furthermore, our integrated platform offers pet products

                            Lack of social consensus and support<br></b></span></font></p>
                            <p><font face="Inter">Numerous pets are being abandoned 
                            and missing, but integrated managementsystems are 
                            still lacking. The number of abandoned animals in 
                            the world isconfirmed to be 6.3 million in the United 
                            States and 7.99 million in India, and petsabandoned 
                            after COVID-19 are emerging as a national problem 
                            in China and theUnited Kingdom.</font></p>
                            <p><font face="Inter">(source : ASPCA / endpethomelessness.com)</font></p>
                            <p><font face="Inter">The social problem with pet 
                            abandonment is that the pet management systemdiffers 
                            by region, animal hospitals, company and country, 
                            and there is a lack ofalternatives to systematically 
                            connect them. Another problem is that there is noplace 
                            to check information about bloodline (submissive, 
                            hybrid) and health status(mental and physical) when 
                            selling or adopting a pet. Even if abandoned pets 
                            wereentrusted to a protection organization, it was 
                            difficult to return them or provideappropriate care 
                            because there was no information about the owner.</font></p>
                            <p><font face="Inter">If information on the animal's 
                            DNA history is recorded and continuously managedeven 
                            before the pet is sold, the pet ecosystem can be 
                            much improved than it is now.However, pet identification 
                            necklaces and built-in wireless devices that thegovernment 
                            had been pushing for at the time were shunned by 
                            dog owners. This isbecause it is ineffective and 
                            only imposes obligations on pets and does not includeany 
                            improvements to make pets healthy and happy unemployed.<br><br>&nbsp;</font></p>

                            ofintegrated management systems. When selling pets, 
                            proper breeds, diseases, andfamily history are not 
                            provided, causing pets to suffer. There is no integrated 
                            systemand standards for pets, so it is difficult
